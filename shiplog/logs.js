        Hello, welcome to the shiplog. This is a bare-bones blog where I will document my progress as a programmer.
    
        I don't use a database â€” all the posts are stored in a master object in my website's source code. I render posts dynamically using raw JavaScript and the DOM API.
    
        A post object looks like this:
    
        <div class="code">
    010220: {
        title: "This is the title of the post.",
        body: "This is the body of the post."
    }
        </div>
    
        I wanted a very simple CMS where I could write posts by adding them to an object.
    
        I want to include pagination in the near future.

          This is a test post.

          <div class="code">
    tests.map(test => "This is a test code block");
          </div>
          `

    body: `

          This is a test post, with an image.
